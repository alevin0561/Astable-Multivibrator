## Introduction

This project showcases a simple yet effective way to create a blinking LED using an astable multivibrator. The astable multivibrator generates a continuous square wave, which is used to turn the LED on and off at regular intervals.

Transistors
LEDs
Power supply
PCB (Printed Circuit Board)

## Circuit Design
The circuit is designed using basic electronic components. The astable multivibrator consists of two transistors, resistors, and capacitors arranged in a feedback loop to produce a square wave. The output of the multivibrator is connected to an LED, causing it to blink.

## How It Works

- Astable Multivibrator: The core of the circuit is the astable multivibrator, which continuously switches between its two states, generating a square wave.
- Square Wave Generation: The transistors in the multivibrator alternately turn on and off, charging and discharging the capacitors. This creates a square wave output.
- LED Blinking: The square wave output is fed to the LED, causing it to blink at a frequency determined by the values of the resistors and capacitors in the circuit.
